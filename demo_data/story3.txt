Detective James Hart had solved countless mysteries in his illustrious career, but none were as perplexing as the one he faced that sunny Saturday afternoon. He stood in the middle of his kitchen, staring at the empty popsicle box in the freezer. The last popsicle was gone, and he had no idea who the culprit was. In a household of five, it could have been anyone.

James' family was a lively bunch: his wife, Emily, who had a penchant for late-night snacks; their teenage son, Max, always raiding the fridge after soccer practice; their daughter, Lily, a curious ten-year-old with a sweet tooth; and their youngest, Emma, a mischievous six-year-old with an innocent face that often masked her antics. The mystery of the missing popsicle was a puzzle that needed solving, and Detective Dad was on the case.

James began his investigation with Emily. She was in the living room, reading a book. "Hey, honey," James said casually, "did you happen to eat the last popsicle?"

Emily looked up, raising an eyebrow. "No, I didn't. I've been trying to cut back on sweets, remember?"

James nodded, making a mental note. Emily was off the suspect listâ€”for now. Next, he approached Max, who was in his room, playing video games. "Max, did you eat the last popsicle?" James asked.

Max paused his game and looked genuinely puzzled. "No, Dad. I had a smoothie after practice. You can check the blender if you don't believe me."

James did check the blender, and sure enough, there were remnants of a smoothie. Max seemed to be telling the truth. That left Lily and Emma. The two girls were playing in the backyard, giggling and chasing each other around.

"Lily, Emma, can you come here for a moment?" James called out.

The girls ran over, their faces flushed with excitement. "What's up, Dad?" Lily asked.

"I'm trying to find out who ate the last popsicle," James said, looking at both of them carefully. "Do either of you know anything about it?"

Lily shook her head. "Nope, I didn't even know we were out of popsicles."

Emma, on the other hand, looked a bit shifty. "It wasn't me, Daddy," she said, but her eyes darted to the side, and she fidgeted with her dress.

James knew that look. It was the same look she had given him when she accidentally spilled juice on the carpet last month. He decided to employ a different tactic. "Alright, girls, let's go inside and have a snack. How about some cookies?"

Emma's face lit up, and she rushed inside. Lily followed, still chatting about her day at school. James watched them carefully as they headed to the kitchen. Emma's eagerness confirmed his suspicion. She was definitely hiding something.

In the kitchen, James pulled out a jar of cookies and handed one to each girl. "Emma," he said gently, "are you sure you didn't eat the last popsicle? It's okay if you did. I just want to know."

Emma hesitated, her cookie halfway to her mouth. She glanced at Lily, who was too busy munching to pay attention, and then back at James. "I didn't eat it, Daddy," she said softly.

James sighed. He didn't want to pressure her, but he needed to get to the bottom of this. He decided to try one more approach. "Emma, remember how we always solve mysteries together? This is just like that. We need to find out who ate the popsicle, and I need your help."

Emma's eyes sparkled at the mention of their mystery games. She loved playing detective with her dad. "Okay, Daddy," she said, nodding. "Let's find out who did it!"

James smiled and ruffled her hair. "That's my girl. Now, let's think. Did you see anyone else in the kitchen today?"

Emma thought for a moment. "I saw Max come in after practice. And Lily was here too, but she was looking for her markers."

James nodded. He knew Max was in the clear, but Lily's mention was interesting. He decided to question her again. "Lily, do you remember seeing the popsicle box when you were looking for your markers?"

Lily looked up from her cookie, thinking hard. "Um, yeah. I saw the box, but it was empty. I was going to ask if we had more, but then I found my markers and forgot."

That was a crucial piece of information. The box was already empty when Lily saw it. James turned back to Emma. "Emma, do you remember when you saw Max and Lily in the kitchen? Was it before or after you had your cookie earlier?"

Emma scrunched her face in concentration. "It was after. I came in to get my markers too, and I saw Max and Lily. But the box was already empty."

James felt he was getting closer. If Emma saw the empty box after both Max and Lily were in the kitchen, that meant the popsicle had disappeared sometime before. He needed to piece together the timeline. "Emily," he called to his wife, "did you see anyone go into the kitchen before you started reading?"

Emily joined them in the kitchen, looking curious. "I think Max went in right after practice, and then Lily and Emma followed a bit later. Why?"

James explained his findings so far, and Emily nodded. "That makes sense. Max came in, made his smoothie, and left. Then Lily and Emma went in after."

James turned to Emma once more. "Emma, are you sure you didn't see anyone else? Maybe someone who came in before Max?"

Emma looked thoughtful again, then her eyes widened. "Oh! I saw Grandpa! He came over to drop off some tools for you, remember?"

James slapped his forehead. How could he have forgotten? His father-in-law, known for his sweet tooth, had indeed dropped by that morning. He must have taken the last popsicle.

With the mystery solved, James gathered his family and shared the revelation. They all had a good laugh, and Emily called her father to confirm. Sure enough, Grandpa admitted to taking the popsicle, not realizing it was the last one.

James hugged Emma and Lily, thanking them for their help. "Great job, detectives," he said, grinning. "We solved the case!"

That evening, as the family enjoyed a new box of popsicles, James couldn't help but feel proud. Solving mysteries with his kids was more rewarding than any case he had ever worked on.
